Near the end of January 2023, I attended Minnehack, an annual hackathon hosted by the ACM club at the University of Minnesota. It was my first taste of what a hackathon can be, and what I lost in sleep that weekend was more than made up for with how much I learned. 

These events are only a few weeks old at the time of writing, but to those reading in the future, it might be pertinent to recall that ChatGPT was released to the public in November 2022. As such, this was in the middle of an omnipresent cultural obsession with NLP. 

As the event began, the theme was announced: **Build something to increase civic engagement.** As my team was sprinting through possible ideas, I suggested we try to build something capable of enhancing the public's legislative understanding. 

Like many other teams, we searched for ways to use NLP in our project. Crucially though, we searched for ideas that *genuinely* seemed like a good fit for it, and actively tried to avoid solutions that boiled down to shoe-horning in the latest buzzwords into inadequate solutions to problems that didn't warrant their use. 

As the ideas developed more, we discovered that the Minnesota Revisor's Office website lists not just the bills proposed during the current legislative session, but also human-written summaries of them. Soon, several details came into focus: the very formulaic nature of legal documents, the abundance of data available, the fact that this data is already separated into two sets-- one to take as input, and the other to validate outputs against, and the public availability of the data.
