After several hours of not being able to figure out why I couldn't get images to display properly, I found the solution, and I'm both embarassed and relieved that it's way simpler than I thought it was going to be. I simply had to rename `selfie-redblue.jpg` to `selfie.jpg`. As of right now, I'm too tired to dig into Hugo's documentation to discover why this is the case, but it's currently 03:46 and I desperately need sleep. I'm committing and pushing the changes I have now, which is the first time this site is going live. It's probably going to break, and that's okay. 

I have tried my best.
